Observations,
,No errors encountered during load testing
,Maximum response time is 23931 milliseconds
,Minimum response time is 283 milliseconds
,99 percentile is less than 1543 milliseconds
Stress Testing,
,"In this test, more than 100 users have been injected concurrently at a regular interval of 30 seconds."
,First internal server error (Code 500) occurred at 125 concurrent users.
,"Eventually, all transactions started failing."
Conclusion,
,"Server successfully handled 50,000 transactions per hour without errors."
,Stress test revealed failure beyond 125 concurrent users.
,System scaling is required to support higher loads.
Next Steps,
,"Monitor CPU, Memory, Network, and Disk utilization."
,Optimize database queries and caching.
,Consider infrastructure scaling to support more concurrent users.
